Eh?

It's a hobby, so that I can learn C.


So... how-?

Run "make".
Then you can run it with kvm like "make kvm".

Aaaa!

If you get an error like:

In file included from /usr/include/features.h:341:0,
                 from /usr/include/stdint.h:25,
                 from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.7/include/stdint.h:3,
                 from kernel.c:1:
/usr/include/stdc-predef.h:30:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
make: *** [kernel.o] Error 1

install the gcc-multilib package.
